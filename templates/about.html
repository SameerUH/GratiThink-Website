        <h3><i><u>Inspiration:</u></i></h3>

        <p>Growing up I had issues with balancing education and other committments and as time went by and exams came closer, I lost motivation and concentration with my studies. After doing research and reading into techniques and books I have found methods to help with motivation by doing little by little per day and celebrating/reflecting on past revision to help motivate future sessions.<br><br>I decided to make this app implementing those methods and techniques to help myself and others with their future studies.</p>

        <h3><i><u>Features:</u></i></h3>
        <ul class="centeredlist">
            <li>Writing and saving entries.</li>
            <li>Performance tracker with counters and graphs.</li>
            <li>Customizable and accessibility features.</li>
            <li>5 questions to answer for a structured approach.</li>
        </ul>
